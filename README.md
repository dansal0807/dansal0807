Hello, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

I'm a Data Engineer with a passion for working with data, exploring its potential applications in artificial intelligence, and devising methods and infrastructure to support data operations. Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm also an academic philosopher deeply engaged in exploring the intersections between philosophy, cognitive science and data science. In software engineering I have deep interest and experience in research on databases and distributed systems.

## My Interests
ðŸ’¼ Data Engineering: Leveraging a broad toolkit ranging from web scraping and API development to blockchain technology and machine learning, aiming to build sophisticated data infrastructures and insights.
ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence: Utilizing AI to not only automate processes but also to explore philosophical questions around intelligence and consciousness.
ðŸ”¬ Cognitive Science and Data Science Intersection: Investigating how principles of cognitive science can enhance data science practices and vice versa, aiming to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.
